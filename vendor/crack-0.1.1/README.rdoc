= crack

Really simple JSON and XML parsing, ripped from Merb and Rails. The XML parser is ripped from Merb and the JSON parser is ripped from Rails. I take no credit, just packaged them for all to enjoy and easily use.

= usage
  
  gem 'crack'
  require 'crack' # for xml and json
  require 'crack/json' # for just json
  require 'crack/xml' # for just xml

= examples
  
  Crack::XML.parse("<tag>This is the contents</tag>")
    # => {'tag' => 'This is the contents'}
  
  Crack::JSON.parse('{"tag":"This is the contents"}')
    # => {'tag' => 'This is the contents'}
